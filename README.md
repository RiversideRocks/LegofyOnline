# LegofyOnline
[Legofy](https://github.com/JuanPotato/Legofy) used online!

## Installing

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/RiversideRocks/LegofyOnline.git`

Run the setup.sh script:

`bash setup.sh`

**IMPORTANT:** You may need to give the I directory read and write permissions.

Open your browser to localhost/LegofyOnline

## Troubleshooting

Your image may not work for the following reasons:

- You did not run the setup.sh script

- The file uses URL parameters (an image like example.com/photo.png?h=39283 will not work but example.com/photo.png will work)

- Something went wrong while installing, open your console and run `legofy`. If that command is not found, please create an issue.
